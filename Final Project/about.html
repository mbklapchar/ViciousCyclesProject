                Our company was founded by John Doe in late 2010 to be a store for bikers. We are committed to providing the best service for our customers. Mr. Doe spent his whole life on pedals.
                He loves to be outside and biking, feeling the air rushing past him, and guiding his journey. Which is why Vicious Cycles believes that biking is an enjoyable experience that anyone can enjoy.
                No matter what type of bike, or accessory you use, anyone can enjoy the thrill of the moment when it comes to biking.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                Our customers are very important. They are people who share our enlightened views of biking. 
                We want to cater to them in any way we can, no matter how or why they choose to bike. Whether competitively, recreationally, any other reason, the customer knows their needs the best.
                We are a business-to-customer organization (B2C).
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                Vicious Cycle products can be purchased at our store. Come on down and we will get started with a purchase of a bike and any accessory you need with cash, credit, or in-house loan approval.
